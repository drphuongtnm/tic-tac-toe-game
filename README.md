## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking spaces with "X" or "O".
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Have fun playing!
